<h1>Mae's Cool About Me and Favorite Horror Movies</h1>

<h2>A Bit About Me:</h2>
<p>My name is Mae, I am a trans woman who really loves to code and I want to make silly videogames! I also like horror movies.</p>
<h2>My Favorite Horror Movies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Alien</li>
    <li>Aliens</li>
    <li>The Thing</li>
    <li>Friday The 13th</li>
    <li>Scream</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-size: smaller;">|disclaimer| The last two movies are not actually favorites I have lied to you.</h3>
<p>I really like both The Thing and Alien as movie concepts. Alien presents a lot of interesting satire by pointing out the flaws<br> of a capitalist society and how it would affect the human population when it comes to a living bioweapon.<br> The Thing is just a very well structured movie. It waits until your guard is down to showcase the creature and the plot then moves forward from there.</p>
