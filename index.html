<h2>A Bit About Me:</h2>

</ul>
<h3 style="font-size: smaller;">|disclaimer| The last two movies are not actually favorites I have lied to you.</h3>
<p>I really like both The Thing and Alien as movie concepts. Alien presents a lot of interesting satire by pointing out the flaws<br> of a capitalist society and how it would affect the human population when it comes to a living bioweapon.<br> The Thing is just a very well structured movie. It waits until your guard is down to showcase the creature and the plot then moves forward from there.</p>
